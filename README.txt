Very Simple WordPress Popup 

== Description ==

Very Simple WordPress Popup is a plugin to create customized popus easily by means of a simple form.

This is how it works:

* The user enters a title, and then selects the width and height, text and background color (including level of transparency), and can also define different types of borders, or none.
* Finally, the user enters the popup content (text that can be formatted with HTML tags).
* Before saving the popup, the user can open a preview.
* Once saved, it is added below to the list of all popups created.
* Popups in the list can be previewed, deleted or copied (to use it wherever the user wishes to).

== Installation ==
